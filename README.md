# [Playstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)) for [MiSTer Platform](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki)


# HW Requirements/Features
SDRam of any size is required.

# Bios
Only scph1001.bin tested.
Rename to boot.rom

# Video output
Core uses either normal output or direct framebuffer mode.

In Framebuffer mode you can choose to view:
- normal drawing area without any overscan cutoff
- full VRAM as 1024x512 pixel image (debug mode)

# Status

Work in progress, don't report any bugs!

- Amidogs CPU test fully passed
- Amidogs GTE math test fully passed
- most rendering functions working
- MDEC logic finished

- some games working with savestate loading
- BIOS startup working
- no booting from CD
