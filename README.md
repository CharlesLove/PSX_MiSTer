# [Playstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)) for [MiSTer Platform](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki)


# HW Requirements/Features
SDRam of any size is required.

# Bios
Only scph1001.bin tested.
Rename to boot.rom

# Video output
Core uses either normal output or direct framebuffer mode.

In Framebuffer mode you can choose to view:
- normal drawing area without any overscan cutoff
- full VRAM as 1024x512 pixel image (debug mode)

# Error messages

If there is a recognized problem, an overlay is displayed, showing which error has occured.
You can hide these messages with an OSD option, by default they are on.

List of Errors:
E1     - missing CD command
E2     - CPU exception
E3..E6 - GPU hangs (e.g. corrupt display list)


# Status

Work in progress, don't report any bugs!
